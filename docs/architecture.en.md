# Ostrakon — for developers

How the project is built, for anyone who wants to extend it: the file structure, the asynchronous
webhook, the task scheduler, and schema migrations. It has nothing to do with installation — that's
in [For the bot's host](for-hosters.en.md). For an overview, see the [README](../README.md).

> On **Nginx**, `.htaccess` is ignored — deny web access to `config/`, `src/`, `logs/`,
> `migrations/` (except `run.php`) and to `*.md`/`*.sql`/`*.log` in the server config, and route
> unknown paths to `index.php`.

`config/bot.php` and `config/db.php` hold secrets and **must not** be committed.

## Asynchronous webhook

Because shared hosting often lacks `fastcgi_finish_request`, the bot never processes updates inline
in the webhook request:

1. `webhook.php` validates the secret, stores the raw update in `update_queue` (deduplicated by
   `update_id`), returns `200` immediately, and best-effort "pokes" the worker via a short
   self-request.
2. `cron.php` is the **worker**: it holds a `flock` (no overlapping runs), loops for
   `worker_loop_seconds`, and every couple of seconds drains the queue (running `Handler::handle`
   per update) and runs any due scheduled tasks.

So responses are fast regardless of `fastcgi_finish_request`, and even an infrequent system cron
keeps things moving (the self-poke covers the gaps when it works).

The worker timing and the self-poke itself are tuned by the `instance` section of
`config/defaults.php` (`worker_loop_seconds`, `worker_poll_seconds`, `worker_self_poke`,
`worker_heartbeat`).

---

## Task scheduler (cron)

`cron.php` reads the `cron_schedule` table: tasks whose `next_run_at <= NOW()` run, then their
`next_run_at` is pushed by the interval from `config/defaults.php`. This fires each task on time and
exactly once even if the system cron runs less than once a minute.

Tasks: `vote_timeouts`, `onboarding_check`, `bot_messages_cleanup` (every minute), `reentry_check`
(5 min), `score_recalc`, `data_ttl` (daily). Overlap is prevented by a `flock` advisory lock on
`logs/do_not_delete_this.lock` (auto-released; never delete it).

---

## Schema migrations

Post-install schema changes go into `migrations/NNN_description/` folders (one action per
`*.sql`/`*.php` file). Folders apply in name order; a folder counts only if all its files succeed
(tracked in `{prefix}migrations`). Use `{prefix}` for table names in `.sql`.

- Web: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/migrations/run.php?token=YOUR_SUPERADMIN_TOKEN`
- CLI: `php migrations/run.php`

## The elder math

The decaying activity score, the status thresholds, and the simulator formulas are in a separate
file: [Elder formulas](formulas.en.md).
